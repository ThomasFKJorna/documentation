# Organizing assets with folders

Folders in the [Media Library](/user-docs/latest/media-library/introduction-to-media-library.md) help you organize uploaded assets. Folders sit at the top of the Media Library view or are accessible from the Media field popup when using the Content Manager.

From the Media Library, it is possible to:

- view the list of folders and [browse](#browsing-folders) a folder's content
- [create new folders](#adding-folders)
- [edit an existing folder](#editing-folders)
- [move assets to a folder](#moving-assets-to-a-folder)
- [delete a folder](#deleting-folders)

## Browsing folders

By default, the Media Library displays folders and assets created at the root level. Double-clicking a folder navigates to this folder. The interface is refreshed with the folder's content and displays:

- the folder title (1)
- the number of subfolders and assets contained (2)
- the subfolders (3) the current folder contains
- all assets (4) from this folder

From this dedicated folder view, folders and assets can be managed, filtered, sorted and searched just like from the main Media Library.

To navigate back to the parent folder, one level up, use the **Back** button at the top of the interface.

## Adding folders

![üèû screenshot - Add new folder popup]()

To create a new folder in the Media Library:

1. Click on **Add new folder** on the upper right of the Media Library interface.
2. In the "Add new folder" popup, type a name for the new folder in the _Folder name_ field.
3. (optional) In the _Folder location_ drop-down list, choose a location for the new folder. The default location is the root of the Media library.
4. Click **Save**.

::: note
There is no limit to how deep your folders hierarchy can go, but bear in mind it might take some effort to reach a deeply nested folder as the Media Library currently has no visual hierarchy indication. Searching for files using the ![Search icon](../assets/icons/search.svg) on the right side of the user interface might be a faster alternative to finding the asset you are looking for.

## Moving assets to a folder

Assets and folders can be moved to another folder from the root view of the Media Library or from any view for a dedicated folder.

![üèû screenshot - "Move elements to" popup]()

To move assets and folders to another folder:

1. Click the checkbox on the left of the folder name, or click the asset itself.
2. Click the blue **Move** button at the top of the interface.
3. In the "Move elements to" popup, select the _Folder location_ where to move items to.
4. Click **Confirm** and wait for the view to refresh.

## Editing folders

Once created, a folder can be renamed, moved or [deleted](#deleting-folders). To manage a single folder:

1. Click the folder name in the Folders view of the Media library.
2. In the "Edit folder" popup, update the name and location with the _Folder name_ field and _Folder location_ drop-down list, respectively.
3. Click **Save** to save the changes and see them reflected in the Media Library interface.

::: tip
From the "Edit folder" popup, you can also delete a folder by clicking the **Delete folder** button.

## Deleting folders

Deleting a folder can be done either from the list of folders of the Media Library, or when editing a single folder.

To delete a folder, from the Media Library:

1. Click the checkbox on the left of the folder name. Multiple folders can be selected.
2. Click the **Delete** button above the Folders list.
3. In the _Confirmation_ dialog, click **Confirm**.

A single folder can also be deleted from the "Edit folder" popup: click on a folder name to open the "Edit folder" popup, then click the **Delete folder** button, and confirm the deletion.
