# Organizing assets with folders

Folders in the [Media Library](/user-docs/latest/media-library/introduction-to-media-library.md) help you organize uploaded assets. Folders sit at the top of the Media Library view or are accessible from the Media field popup when using the Content Manager.

From the Media Library, it is possible to:

- view the list of folders
- navigate inside a folder by double-clicking it to display the assets the folder contains
- [create new folders](#adding-folders)
- edit an existing folder
- move a folder
- delete a folder

Moving an uploaded asset to an existing folder is done by individually editing the asset.
