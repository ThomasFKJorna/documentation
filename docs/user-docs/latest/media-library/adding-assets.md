# Adding assets

<!-- TODO: review intro -->

<!-- assets only added via Media Library -->
The Media Library displays all assets uploaded in the application, either via the [Media Library](/user-docs/latest/media-library/introduction-to-media-library.md) or the [Content Manager](/user-docs/latest/content-manager/writing-content.md#filling-up-fields) when managing a media field.

<!-- TODO: remove -->
<!-- Assets can be added to the Media Library by clicking the **Add new assets** button. -->

To add new assets to the media library:

1. Click the **Add new assets** button.
2. Choose whether you want to upload the new asset from your computer or from an URL:
    - from the computer, either drag & drop the asset directly or browse files on your system,
    - from an URL, type or copy and paste an URL(s) in the _URL_ field, making sure multiple URLs are separated by carriage returns, then click **Next**.
3. (optional) Click the edit button ![Edit icon](../assets/icons/edit.svg) to view asset metadata and define an _Alternative text_ and a _Caption_ for the asset (see [editing and deleting assets](./editing-and-deleting-assets.md)).
4. (optional) Add more assets by clicking **Add new assets** and going back to step 2.
5. Click on **Upload x assets to the library** (where x represents the number of new assets to be added).
